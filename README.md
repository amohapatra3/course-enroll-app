# Course search and enroll

This **ReactJS** application was made for a class project. It simulates a course enrollment system. Use this application to learn more about some of the courses offered by the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

## Overview

You can use this application to view course information, filter courses based on parameters, add courses to cart, and remove courses from the cart.

## Viewing course information

Each course is listed in an accordion display with a name and number, as shown below.

Click on the course you want to learn more about. You will see an expanded view, as shown below.

The expanded view displays course information such as credits, description, requisites, search keywords, and subject. In addition, the view lists sections and subsections for each course (if the course has subsections).

Section information includes section number, instructor, location and meeting times. Subsection information includes the subsection number, location, and meeting times.

## Using the search feature

You can use the search feature to filter the course list based on specific parameters, as seen in the expanded view. The parameters include search keywords, subject, and credits. These parameters can be used in the following ways:

- Entering a keyword in the search bar. Only courses with the entered keyword are displayed.

- Selecting a subject from the dropdown menu. Only courses with the selected subject are displayed.

- Specifying a range of credits. Only courses in the credit range, maximum and minimum inclusive, are displayed.

  - If either value is unspecified, the other is assumed as a bound. For example, only specifying a minimum of 3 credits will display all courses with 3 credits or more.

  - Similarly, specifying only a maximum of 3 credits will display courses with 3 credits or less.

## Utilizing the cart feature

The application allows you to add or remove courses from a cart. This simulates real course enrollment systems.

To use the cart, click on the **Cart** tab on the top left corner of the page. You can toggle between **Search** and **Cart** by clicking on either tab.

### Adding to cart

You can add to the cart in 3 different configurations:

1. Add all sections and subsections of a course.
2. Add a specific section and all subsections within that section.
3. Add a specific subsection of the course.

Follow these steps to add to the cart:

1. Click the course you want to add to the cart.
2. Click a button in the expanded view based on what course configuration you want to add to the cart.

   - Click **Add course to cart** to add a course and all its sections and subsections to the cart.

   **Note:** You will not be able to add individual sections or subsections of the added course to the cart after this action.

   - Click **Add section to cart** to add a specific section of the course, along with all its subsections.

   **Note:** You will not be able to add individual subsections of the added section to the cart after this action.

   - Click **Add subsection to cart** to add a specific course subsection to the cart.

3. You will now be able to see course information on the right hand side of the page. This list of information represents the cart, and it will reflect the button(s) you clicked. New additions will append to the end of the list.
